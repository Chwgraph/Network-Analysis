# Network-Analysis
Basic network analysis for networks of American college football games and coauthorships in high-energy physics theory

# Introduction
Real-world networks are useful models for data analysis. In this project, we select two certain networks: the network of American College Football Games and the network of High-Energy Physics Theory Coauthorships as representatives. We calculated their basic parameters, detected communities in them, and performed attacks to test their network resilience. In the final section of the report, we analyze our results and determine the special network classes that they are in alternately by the properties of these two networks.
